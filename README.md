# Weather App
This is a weather app that uses the OpenWeather API to request what the current weather is in the specified location entered in the user input. 

## The Languages and Technologies used

- JS (Native)
- Open Weather API

https://openweathermap.org/

## How API works
In this app, the user will enter a location e.g. Berlin, Philadelphia and the input will GET request
the necessary data needed such as the following:
- name of the location
- current date
- temperature
- current weather e.g. clouds, raining, etc.
- high and low temperature

## TODO in forseeable future
- allow background to change based on temperature
- allow ability for the user to switch between metric or imperial units.
